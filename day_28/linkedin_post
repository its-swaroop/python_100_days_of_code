Today I built a Pomodoro Timer App using Python’s Tkinter library.
Day 28 of #100DaysOfCode

This project helped me practice both GUI layout (labels, canvas, grid) and event-driven logic (using Tkinter’s after() instead of blocking the UI).

Key takeaways:

-after() lets timers run without freezing the GUI
-Session cycle: Work → Break → Work → Long Break
-after_cancel() is crucial for the Reset button (avoids multiple timers)
-A checkmark tracker gives instant visual feedback on progress

Next step: extend it with a Pause button, custom durations, or dark mode toggle.
