- Handle events like button clicks.

- Work with function arguments (*args, **kwargs) in a real project.

- Build a small Miles to Km converter app as practice.

'''What stood out: GUIs are all about event-driven programming ‚Äî instead of our code running top-to-bottom, the program waits for the user to act. That shift in thinking is powerful.'''

If you‚Äôre learning Python and want to see instant, interactive results, Tkinter is a great next step.
