“Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” – Murphy’s Law
Today’s #100DaysOfCode session reminded me just how true that is in software development.

We worked on upgrading a password manager app:
-Moved from plain text files to JSON storage for safer, structured data.
-Added search functionality to quickly retrieve credentials.
-Used try/except blocks to prevent crashes when files are missing or corrupted.

Why this matters:
When handling real-world data, it’s not enough for code to work. It has to fail gracefully.
Murphy’s Law guarantees something will break — our job as developers is to make sure it doesn’t take everything down with it.

Next step: Adding encryption so even if files are leaked, data stays safe.
