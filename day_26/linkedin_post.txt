Today I dove into Python list & dictionary comprehensions and learned how to turn loops into one-liners.
#Day 26 /100DaysOfCode

Highlights:

- [n+1 for n in numbers] replaces multi-line loops.

- {k:v for k,v in dict.items() if v>60} makes filtering dictionaries super clean.

- Iterating through Pandas DataFrames with .iterrows() unlocks row-wise operations.

- Built a NATO phonetic alphabet tool that converts any input word into phonetic code words. 

'''Python makes repetition elegant, and comprehension is the magic key ðŸ”‘.'''
