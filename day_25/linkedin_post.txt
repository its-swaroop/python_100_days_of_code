Today I dove into CSV data & the Pandas library.
Instead of wrestling with Pythonâ€™s raw csv module, I learned how Pandas makes data handling so much cleaner.
#Day 25 /100 Days of Code

ðŸ”‘ Highlights:

- Load CSVs into DataFrames with just one line.
- Treat columns like lists/dictionaries.
- Quick stats with .mean(), .max().
- Filter rows with simple conditions (data[data.day == "Monday"]).
- Create & save new CSVs from scratch.

'''It feels like unlocking Excel superpowers in Python â€” but way more flexible.'''

Next step: applying this to real projects!
